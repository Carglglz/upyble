    <Note>
        	<p>
        		Characters which require more than one octet when encoded in UTF-8 are transmitted with the leading byte first, followed by the continuation bytes ordered in accordance with UTF-8 encoding. In UTF-8, the leading byte is identified by possessing two or more high-order 1’s followed by a 0 while continuation bytes all have '10' in the high-order position.
        		
				Strings which consist of more than one character are transmitted in the following order: the character which appears furthest to the left when the string is presented in its written form shall be sent first, followed by the remaining characters in order.
